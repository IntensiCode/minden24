### Minden24

2024 Remake of an 1988 Amiga Patience style card game I enjoyed a lot back in the day.

Playable version: https://intensicode.github.io/minden24/

### To Do

* end screen with poem and picture (original?)
* music selection dialog
* help button for showing how-to-play dialog
* title screen? or just popup how-to-play dialog?
* show how-to-play dialog initially if no title screen
* animate undo somehow?
